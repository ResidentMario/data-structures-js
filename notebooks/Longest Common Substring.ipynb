    "This is a substring search problem. It occurs in various real-world contexts, like shell completion and finding matching segments in long DNA sequences. If we limit ourselves to just characters with matching indices, this problem is trivial, and can be solved in $O(n)$ time using a one line map-reduce operation. What makes this problem challenging is that we are not limiting ourselves to just matching indices, but matches anywhere in the string."

Syntax errors are errors in the way that you using the language you are writing the program in (for example, incorrectly concatenating variables of different types). If you write the program in a true language immediately, you will need to keep both kinds of errors in mind simultaneously. By writing the program in psuedocode first you can focus solely on logical correctness first, and on syntactic correctness later.\n",
